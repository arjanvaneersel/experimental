Installation
============

As of 2011/03/29 this requires the weekly snapshot of Go.
On ubuntu linux you can get this by doing:

    add-apt-repository ppa:niemeyer/ppa
    apt-get update
    apt-get install golang-weekly

It also requires the raptor library version 2. There may
be packages for this, or else installing it from source
is straightforward. http://librdf.org/raptor/

For further instructions see the documentation in the 
ckand subdirectory.
